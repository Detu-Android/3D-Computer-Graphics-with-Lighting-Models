# 3D-Computer-Graphics-with-Lighting-Models
This is a school project of 3D computer graphics, and I implemented the code given in the lab. I now added a sphere, torus, cylinder, ellipsoid, and box. I also implement the point light source and infinite light in my objects, and users can rotate at any angle to view. More over, I implemented translation, rotation, and scaling of the objects or camera. As for my lighting property, users can press keys interaction to change the property of lighting and I have Phong, Gouraud, Flat shading for all my objects and three different scenes.
